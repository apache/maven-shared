${project.name}

  Classes to prepare report plugins execution with Maven 3, through
  {{{./apidocs/org/apache/maven/reporting/exec/MavenReportExecutor.html}MavenReportExecutor}}
  ({{{./apidocs/org/apache/maven/reporting/exec/DefaultMavenReportExecutor.html}implementation}}).

  Since 1.4, the request can (and should) be populated from
  {{{/ref/current/maven-model/maven.html#class_reporting}pom's <<<\<reporting\>>>> section}},
  injected in Mojo parameter as <<<$\{project.reporting.plugins\}>>> default value:

+----+
    @Parameter( defaultValue = "${esc.d}{project.reporting.plugins}", readonly = true )
    private org.apache.maven.model.ReportPlugin[] reportingPlugins;
+----+

  Contrary to Maven 2.x, report <<<\<version\>>>> explicit definition is optional:
  if no version is specified for a report plugin, version is determined by

    [[1]] searching for the plugin in the <<<build/plugins>>> section of the pom,
 
    [[2]] searching for the plugin in the <<<build/pluginManagement>>> section of the pom,

    [[3]] asking {{{/ref/current/maven-core/apidocs/org/apache/maven/plugin/version/PluginVersionResolver.html}PluginVersionResolver}}
    to get a fallback version and display a warning as it's not a recommended use.

    []

  Since <<<maven-reporting-exec>>> 1.2 (which is used by <<<maven-site-plugin>>> 3.4), plugin configuration in
  <<<build/pluginManagement>>> is also injected into reports.

* Notice on now obsolete reportPlugin format

  This section is kept to explain what happened in previous releases of the component, but this approach has been
  abandonned so far after discovering major limitations: see
  {{{/plugins/maven-site-plugin/maven-3.html#New_Configuration_Maven_3_only_no_reports_configuration_inheritance}Maven Site Plugin documentation}}
  for more details.

  Report plugins can be configured in <<<\<configuration\>>>> element of <<<maven-site-plugin>>> or any other
  report building plugin with following XML model corresponding to plugin's
  <<<List<{{{./apidocs/org/apache/maven/reporting/exec/ReportPlugin.html}ReportPlugin}}>>>> parameter:

+----+
<reportPlugins>
  <reportPlugin>
    <groupId/>
    <artifactId/>
    <version/>
    <configuration/>
    <reports/>
    <reportSets>
      <reportSet>
        <id/>
        <configuration/>
        <reports/>
      </reportSet>
    </reportSets>
  </reportPlugin>
</reportPlugins>
+----+

  Notice this is the model from plugins in
  {{{/ref/current/maven-model/maven.html#class_reporting}<<<\<reporting\>>>> section of POM}}:

  * without <<<\<inherited\>>>> element: reporting plugins configuration inheritance is not supported at this level
  (see {{{https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MSITE-484}MSITE-484}}),

  * with additional <<<\<reports\>>>> list outside <<<\<reportSet\>>>> that simplifies reports configuration in usual cases.

  []

  Maven 3 core makes an automatic transformation of <<<\<reporting\>>>> POM section (which supports configuration inheritance)
  to <<<maven-site-plugin>>>'s <<<reportPlugins>>> configuration through the
  {{{/ref/current/maven-model-builder/apidocs/org/apache/maven/model/plugin/ReportingConverter.html}ReportingConverter}}
  component.

  But Maven 3 does not do the same job for any other plugin wanting to use reports, like <<<maven-pdf-plugin>>> for example:
  this is one of the key limitations that made Maven team drop this approach.
