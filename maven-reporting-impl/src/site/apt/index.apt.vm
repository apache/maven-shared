${project.name}

  Abstract classes to manage report generation, which can be run both:
  
  * as part of a site generation, as a {{{../maven-reporting-api/}maven-reporting-api}}'s
  <<<{{{../maven-reporting-api/apidocs/org/apache/maven/reporting/MavenReport.html}MavenReport}}>>>,

  * or as a direct standalone goal invocation, as a {{{/ref/current/maven-plugin-api/}maven-plugin-api}}'s
  <<<{{{/ref/current/maven-plugin-api/apidocs/org/apache/maven/plugin/Mojo.html}Mojo}}>>>.

  []

* Usage

  A full working sample is included in <<<maven-reporting-impl>>> ITs, which are part of 
  {{{../source-repository.html}the component source tree}}: see <<<src/it/setup-reporting-plugin>>>.

* History

** inclusion in Maven core

  Until Maven 2.0.4, <<<maven-reporting-impl>>> was included in Maven 2 core distribution: version
  used was completely driven by Maven version used.
  
  The module was removed from Maven core starting with Maven 2.0.5 and
  moved to shared components to improve fexibility: starting with Maven 2.0.5, each plugin can choose its
  <<<maven-reporting-impl>>> version independently from Maven.

** Doxia dependency

  <<<maven-reporting-impl 2.0.x>>> use Doxia 1.0, then is used for reporting plugins wanting Maven 2.0.x compatibility.

  <<<maven-reporting-impl 2.1.x>>> use Doxia 1.1: using this version implies for a reporting plugin that it has Maven 2.1
  as prerequisite.

  <<<maven-reporting-impl 2.2.x>>> use Doxia 1.2.
